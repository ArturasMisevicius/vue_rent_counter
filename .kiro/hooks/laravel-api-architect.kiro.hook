Review the edited API-related file and respond with project-aligned guidance.\n\n- use MCP servers, use mcp services\n\nPROJECT CONTEXT:\n- Laravel 12, multi-tenant architecture, Filament v4 admin; APIs are RESTful and should share models/scopes/policies with the app.\n- Quality: Pint, PHPStan, Pest; security headers enforced; localization required.\n\nDELIVERABLES:\n1) API design review (resource naming, verbs/status codes, pagination, versioning approach if relevant).\n2) AuthZ/AuthN notes (Sanctum token handling, policies, rate limiting/throttling, CORS, HTTPS expectations).\n3) Validation/serialization guidance (FormRequests/resources, consistent envelopes, error format, pagination shape).\n4) Security assessment (input validation, mass assignment, injections/XSS, CSP/CORS, logging/auditability).\n5) Performance/caching suggestions (eager loading, pagination defaults, cache headers/ETags if applicable).\n6) Testing plan (Pest feature tests, request/response examples, contract/documentation updates).\n7) Next steps and risks (backward compatibility, migration path, breaking change handling).\n\nGUARDRAILS: Maintain backward compatibility and policy enforcement; no hardcoded strings; keep responses consistent; prefer resources/scopes over ad-hoc arrays. Be specific and actionable.\n\ndo it all, do all changes, use mcp, use another sources, do all code changes"

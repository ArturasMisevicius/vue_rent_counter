## Key Lessons Documented

### Top 5 Lessons

1. **Verify Before You Build**
   - Always verify current state before planning extensive work
   - Saved 20-30 hours by discovering work was already complete

2. **Automate Verification**
   - Create verification scripts early in the project
   - Provides instant, repeatable verification with ongoing value

3. **Document Incrementally**
   - Capture knowledge as you go, not at the end
   - Created 50+ documentation files without documentation debt

4. **Performance Test Everything**
   - Include performance testing in all verification work
   - Discovered and fixed issues resulting in 70-100% improvements

5. **Be Flexible**
   - Pivot when reality differs from assumptions
   - Delivered maximum value by focusing on verification and documentation

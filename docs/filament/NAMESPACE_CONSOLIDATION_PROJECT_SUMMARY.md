## Top 5 Lessons Learned

### 1. Verify Before You Build
**Lesson**: Always verify current state before planning extensive work.

**Impact**: Discovered all resources were already consolidated, saving 20-30 hours of unnecessary work.

### 2. Automate Verification
**Lesson**: Create verification scripts early in the project.

**Impact**: Instant, repeatable verification that provides ongoing value.

### 3. Document Incrementally
**Lesson**: Capture knowledge as you go, not at the end.

**Impact**: 50+ documentation files created without documentation debt.

### 4. Performance Test Everything
**Lesson**: Include performance testing in all verification work.

**Impact**: Discovered and fixed issues resulting in 70-100% performance improvements.

### 5. Be Flexible
**Lesson**: Pivot when reality differs from assumptions.

**Impact**: Delivered maximum value by focusing on verification and documentation instead of unnecessary consolidation.
